# Leaf Skeleton

Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Leaf PHP application without using a full-blown framework. Unlike [Leaf MVC](//leafmvc.netlify.app) and [Leaf API](//leafphp.netlify.app/#/leaf-api/), Skeleton keeps leaf as is, and doesn't build on top of it, it's perfect for creating smaller projects.

## Installation

It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install Leaf.

```bash
composer create-project leafs/skeleton <project-name>
```

## Other Leaf Projects

Leaf API is a lightweight PHP MVC framework for rapid API development. It serves as minimal MVC wrapper around Leaf PHP Framework which allows you to use Leaf in an MVC environment. It also comes along with a bunch of handy tools which can speed up your development.
