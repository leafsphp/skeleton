# Leaf Skeleton 3

Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Leaf PHP application without using a full-blown framework. Unlike [Leaf MVC](//mvc.leafphp.dev) and [Skeleton](//api.leafphp.dev), Skeleton keeps leaf as is, and doesn't build on top of it, it's perfect for creating smaller projects.

Skeleton 3 is built with Leaf 3 which makes it smaller and faster than earlier versions. It is also powered by modules which makes it easy to upgrade and use.

## üì¶ Installation

You can install Skeleton v3 with the [Leaf CLI](https://cli.leafphp.dev)

```sh
leaf create <project-name> --v3 --skeleton
```

`<project-name>` is your project name

You can also use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install Skeleton quickly.

```bash
composer create-project leafs/skeleton <project-name>
```

This will start a new Skeleton app.

## üìì Learning Skeleton

Skeleton has a very easy to understand [documentation](https://skeleton.leafphp.dev) which contains information on all operations in Skeleton.

Since Skeleton runs on Leaf, you should check out the Leaf PHP Framework documentation [here](https://leafphp.dev).
